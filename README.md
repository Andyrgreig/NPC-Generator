### NPC Generator

This is a tutorial project for the Full-Stack developer course on Codecademy. 

The program generates an NPC description for The Skylands, a homebrew fantasy RPG setting I designed.

#### Technologies Used
   * JavaScript
   * Git and GitHub
   * VS Code
   * Node.js
   * 
   
#### Enhancements
I plan to add the following enhancements when I have time:
* Add gender (randomly generated)
* Add names, to be generated based on culture & gender 
* Additional descriptions
* Weight ancestry results based on generated culture (some ancestries are more common in particular cultures).
